# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

ensemble is an open-source collaborative spreadsheet SDK. A [Univer](https://univer.ai)-powered editor + a Hono server + pluggable adapters (identity / permission / storage / event / risk / template / OCR / PDF / LLM / agent-policy) so a host application keeps full control of auth, data, and policy. **Scope is locked to spreadsheets** — doc / slide / form / PDF / mindmap / flowchart / smart-canvas are permanent non-goals.

## Commands

The `Makefile` is the canonical entry point — it pins port assignments and runs the right dependency graph. Use it instead of remembering raw `pnpm` invocations.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| First-time setup (install + docker + migrate) | `make setup` |
| Run the demo (foreground, Ctrl-C stops both) | `make dev` |
| Run the demo in background | `make dev-bg` ; stop with `make dev-down` |
| Restart after touching `core` / `react` / `server` | `make restart` (kills procs, rebuilds the 3 libs, then `dev`) |
| Build everything | `make build` |
| Build only what demo needs | `make build-libs` (core + react + server) |
| Typecheck whole workspace | `make typecheck` |
| Run all unit tests | `make test` |
| Playwright e2e | `make e2e` |
| v0.1 capability audit on isolated ports | `make audit` (uses 5311/5312, does not disturb running dev) |
| Pre-ship full pipeline | `make verify` (typecheck + test + build-libs + audit) |
| Postgres + Redis containers | `make db-up` / `make db-down` |
| Docs site dev | `make docs-dev` |

Port layout: server `5301` · web `5302` · postgres `5303` · redis `5304` · audit-server `5311` · audit-web `5312`. Do not change these without updating both the Makefile and `apps/demo/docker-compose.dev.yml`.

### Targeted operations (when Make is too coarse)

```bash
# Single package test
pnpm --filter @ensemble-sheets/core test
# Single test file
pnpm --filter @ensemble-sheets/core exec vitest run test/pivot.test.ts
# Single package build (use this after editing one lib instead of `make build`)
pnpm --filter @ensemble-sheets/server build
# Lint (Biome; --write to fix)
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix
# Run a server integration test (requires docker + 5303/5304 up)
pnpm --filter @ensemble-sheets/server exec vitest run test/integration/<name>.int.test.ts
```

Integration tests under `packages/server/test/integration/*.int.test.ts` spin up testcontainers and need Docker. If `pnpm -r test` fails on `migrate.js`, run `make setup` once — it builds the server and runs migrations.

## Architecture

### Topology

```
Browser (React / Vue) ──► @ensemble-sheets/core ──► Univer editor
       │ HTTP                  │ WebSocket
       ▼                       ▼
@ensemble-sheets/server (Hono + drizzle + Redis)
       │
       ├── REST routes        (folders / workbooks / snapshots / versions / grants /
       │                       activity / comments / protections / ai / admin / range /
       │                       templates / export.xlsx / export.pdf / metrics / openapi)
       ├── WebSocket bridge   (cell-region locks → mutation broadcast with per-recipient mask)
       ├── Adapters           (identity, permission, storage, event, llm, risk, oauth,
       │                       agent-policy, ocr, pdfRenderer, template, error)
       └── NotificationBus    (in-process pub/sub for @mention real-time push)
```

The data plane sits on Postgres (drizzle schema in `packages/server/src/db/schema.ts`) with **Postgres RLS** enforcing tenant isolation (ADR-0001) — every request runs in a transaction with `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`. Redis backs cell-region locks (`SET NX EX`, 30s TTL) and mask-cache pub/sub invalidation.

### Single-user mode

Both `createServer` and `mountWorkbookEditor` accept a `collab?: boolean` flag (default `true`). Pass `collab: false` on both ends to disable all real-time collab subsystems — no WS bridge, no Redis client, no cell-region locks, no presence, no mutation broadcaster, no session registry, no offline mutation queue. The editor still loads and saves via REST snapshots. Use this mode when you only need editor + persistence and don't need multi-user cursors / locks / live broadcast. The server-side mode also makes Redis optional at startup.

### The two non-obvious load-bearing ideas

1. **Cell-region locks instead of CRDT** (ADR-0002). When two users hit the same cell concurrently, ensemble does *not* last-write-wins — the server arbitrates via a Redis lock and rejects the loser with `lock_required`. The CRDT alternative ships as a separate adapter contract in `@ensemble-sheets/crdt` (LWW reference impl; a Yjs binding will land here in a future sprint) — never mix the two on the same workbook.
2. **Per-recipient mask broadcast.** Every outbound `apply_mutation` frame is re-rendered through the recipient's *current* `MaskRuleCache` entry (no cached snapshot ever leaves the server unmasked). Same applies to `versions/diff` (4.5 fix) and `export.{xlsx,pdf}` routes. **If you add any code path that emits snapshot bytes to a user, you must apply `applyMaskRules(data, await services.masks.get(idCtx, wbId))` first.**

### Mount lifecycle (client)

`mountWorkbookEditor(opts)` → returns `MountHandle`. It owns: Univer editor, the `WsClient` (with auto-reconnect + exponential backoff + `last_seq=` replay), a custom-function registry, a 30 Hz cursor heartbeat throttle, an optional IndexedDB offline mutation queue (drained on every keepalive tick), and watermark / preventCopy overlays. The handle exposes:

- `save / exportXlsx / destroy`
- `onMutationApplied / onPresence / onSaved / onConnectionChange / onNotification`
- `readRange(A1) / setFrozen / registerCustomFunction`
- `connectionState()` ∈ `connecting | connected | reconnecting | offline`

`WorkbookEditor.tsx` clears the container's children before *and* after mount to defend against Univer leaving canvas siblings during fast workbook-id switches (F7.1).

### Adapter contract pattern

Adapters live under `packages/server/src/adapters/`. Each has a TS interface + a default implementation (typically `Noop*` / `NotImplemented*`). Hosts pass concrete instances into `createServer({...})`; routes pull them from `c.get('deps')`. **When adding a new optional capability, follow this shape**: optional adapter on `AppDeps` → REST route returns a 503 with a helpful notice when the adapter is absent (see `templates.ts`). A portable test pack lives in `@ensemble-sheets/adapter-conformance` — any host implementation should pass it.

### TypeScript strictness

`tsconfig.base.json` enables `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`. The last two bite the most:

- Optional fields must be conditionally spread, never set to `undefined`: `{ ...(x ? { key: x } : {}) }`.
- `import type` is required for type-only imports (Biome enforces `useImportType` as error).

### Auto-memory + Fact-Forcing gate

This repo uses an ECC GateGuard hook that intercepts the first `Edit`/`Write` per file and requires a 4-fact prefix (importers / public surface / data I/O / verbatim user instruction). Don't fight it — present the facts succinctly before each new-file or first-touch edit. Recovery: `ECC_GATEGUARD=off` or `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS=pre:edit-write:gateguard-fact-force`. Memory store at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-cedric-Projects-localized-ensemble/memory/`.

## Critical conventions

- **Scope lock**: sheets only. Reject doc/slide/form/PDF features even when "while we're here it'd be easy" — the user has flagged this as a hard rule.
- **Mask before emit**: any snapshot leaving the server passes through `applyMaskRules` against the *current* viewer's rules. The historic snapshot's original mask is never trusted.
- **Defense in depth at three layers**: HTTP (`requireCapability`), WS (`capabilities.canEdit` re-check on every frame in `ws/session.ts`), and client (`MountOpts.capabilities` only shapes UX). Never collapse to one layer.
- **Never amend pushed commits.** Create a new commit; the pre-existing repo history is part of the audit trail.
- **Migrations** live in `packages/server/drizzle/`. After editing `schema.ts`, run `pnpm --filter @ensemble-sheets/server exec drizzle-kit generate` and commit the generated `*.sql`. Apply with `make migrate`.
- **No new heavy dependencies without a reason** — the metrics + tracing primitives are hand-rolled specifically to avoid pulling the full OTEL tree; follow the same instinct.
